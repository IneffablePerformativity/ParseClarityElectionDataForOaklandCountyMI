 * Goal: Parsing the "Clarity" type of 2020 Election data for Oakland County Michigan.
 * via https://www.oakgov.com/clerkrod/elections/Pages/default.aspx
 * via https://results.enr.clarityelections.com/MI/Oakland/105840/
 * Where I manually downloaded detailxml.zip, extracted detail.xml,
 * and renamed it: OaklandCountyMI-detail.xml
 * 
 * to demonstrate any inverse republicanism::trump relationship
 * as was described for Milwaukee County Wisconsin in an article at:

 * There is a series of similar programs building upon one another,
 * named similarly, with XML inputs, HTML inputs, PDF-as-TXT input,
 * and some ugly earlier versions, all to be found at GitHub, here:

 * 
 * 
 * Pre- 2020-11-26 programs had an error, just fixed, soon to fix in those.
 * To Wit, I did not make a "Four" thing upon each grain, but outside loop.
 * Therefore, all the vote counts were merging into forever ascending sums.
 * Corrected on 2020-11-26. Henceforth you can trust me, 'til next mistake.
 * 
 * 
 * also note, I manually compress final image at tinypng.com
